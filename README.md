# form-components

A list of custom react form components of mine hosted on bit.dev. You can install any of the form-components directly via NPM to your project folder. For example, you can install the toggle component as a package:

```
npm i @bit/chigozieorunta.form-components.ToggleControl
```

You can also install via Yarn:

```
yarn add @bit/chigozieorunta.form-components.ToggleControl
```

Or Bit:

```
bit import chigozieorunta.form-components/ToggleControl
```

### Usage

Once added to your project folder, you can import into your components like so:

```
import React from 'react';
import ToggleControl from '@bit/chigozieorunta.form-components.ToggleControl';
```
